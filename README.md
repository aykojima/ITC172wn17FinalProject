# ITC172wn17FinalProject
a Community Assist web application

--Project Instruction--
The purpose of the final project is to put everything together, and make a Community Assist web application.
Make a web site that has:
A general information page or area that introduces Community Assist and shows what services they offer
a place to login
a place to make donations
a place to apply for a grant
a place to see your donations if you are a donor
a place to see your grants if you have applied for assistance
I said places, because you are free to layout and design the website however you wish.
You can use and/or adapt the elements you have used in the assignments. It would be best to use all classical ADO or all WCF services with Data Entities. You should validate form fields as needed.
Add at least one more component to the web site. This could be something like a calendar of events or a summary of services offered, anything extra that you can thing of. 5 points will be assigned for this extra element.
Add some CSS. You can go wild and make it as pretty as you wish. However, I will not grade on the prettiness, only on the simple presence of some CSS.
You may work alone or with others. If with others--put everyone's name on the project--but have each individual post it separately (That way I make sure everyone gets their grade.)
